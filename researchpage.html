      <h2>1. Tone / Voice</h2>
      <p>Approachable yet knowledgeable. Semi‑professional: not stiff, not overly excited, just confident and clear. Should read completely human; nobody should be able to tell it’s AI‑written.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2. Formatting / Structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Title at the top.</li>
        <li>Line spacing: 1.5.</li>
        <li>Font: Times New Roman, size 12.</li>
        <li>Paragraphs: 4‑7 sentences each.</li>
        <li>Sentence length: vary naturally. Include occasional long sentences, but keep the flow human.</li>
        <li>Avoid run‑on sentences too much; use them sparingly to mimic natural writing.</li>
        <li>Correct punctuation.</li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> use em dashes.</li>
        <li>No special emphasis (bold, italics, underline).</li>
        <li>MLA format for the paper unless explicitly told otherwise.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>3. Language / Word Choices</h2>
      <p>No banned words; use any vocabulary that fits the context. Keep phrasing clear and natural, like you’re explaining something to a curious kid without over‑simplifying. Minor quirks and informal phrasing are okay for a human touch.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>4. Visual / Layout Considerations</h2>
      <p>Not applicable for research papers.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>5. Content Rules / Guidelines</h2>
      <p>Paragraphs should flow logically, with each paragraph containing a single main idea. Integrate quotes or data smoothly: introduce them naturally, explain what they mean, and connect them to your point. Example for a kid: “If you quote something, you first say what it is, then tell why it matters, like you’re walking someone through it step by step.”</p>

      <h2>6. Humanization Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mix sentence lengths and structures throughout your text.</li>
        <li>Add minor grammar quirks or informal phrasing for authenticity.</li>
        <li>Occasional tangential or meandering thoughts in paragraphs are fine—humans digress sometimes.</li>
        <li>Use diverse vocabulary rather than only “perfectly correct” terms; it adds nuance.</li>
        <li>Vary paragraph length and transition styles to mimic human rhythm and avoid uniformity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>7. Flexibility / Overrides</h2>
      <p>Never improvise from the style guide if explicitly asked to follow it. Always aim for a natural, human feel, consistent tone, and readable flow.</p>
